                        I earned my Advanced Studies Diploma from Blacksburg High School in May 2019. I was a

                    <p>
                        I am currently working as an intern at an automotive manufacturing company called Federal-Mogul
                        which is owned by Tenneco. I began interning at the beginning of January 2021 and plan to stay
                        through at least the summer before possibly heading off to continue my education elsewhere. I
                        am responsible for developing programs using a development environment called LabVIEW. The
                        current application I'm programming is meant to read hundreds of thousands of data entries of
                        manufactured bearings and give a comprehensive review of how many passed inspection and how
                        many were scrapped.

                    <p>
                        I began programming my senior year of high school. I earned a 5 on the AP Computer science A
                        exam and decided to major in computer science. Since then, I am self taught in C++, Python,
                        Swift, HTML, and CSS. In fact, I learned HTML and CSS for the purpose of making this site!

                    <p>
                        I have excelled in mathematics throughout both high school and college. I was a member of Mu
                        Alpha Theta in high school and earned a A in Calculus I my senior year. In college I have
                        earned A's in all classes with heavy math including Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, and University
                        Physics.

                    <h3>Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my favorite things about life is the ability to learn and grow! I sincerely believe that
                        continuous learning is vital throughout life. Even outside of school, I take time everyday to
                        learn new skills (most of which is programming)! I mostly use a website called Udemy to learn
                        and have learned almost all the programming languages I know using Udemy. This website you're
                        looking at right now is a product from a Udemy course on web design and my ambition to learn!

                    <h3>Traveling</h3>
                    <p>
                        I absolutely love to travel and have the opportunity to experience other cultures around the
                        world! Before the pandemic brought everything to a grinding halt, I had traveled to Canada,
                        Belize, and Egypt with plans travel throughout Europe during summer break. I truly believe
                        traveling and experiencing other cultures is the only way to gain a clearer vision of how the
                        world actually works. I can't wait until I'm able to grap my passport and fly off to another
                        country again!
